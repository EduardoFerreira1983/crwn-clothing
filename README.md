# Fourth day
I made a progress and start with Routes from React and woks very well.

In the afternoon I start handle with firebase.  Begin we connect to db and do a login with google authentication.

In the evening I almost finish this part from  project. After fight with firebase and forms for a long time, in the final of the day I finish to do a login with new users configuration.

## Fiveth day

Today the time for studies is small its because is sunday and father's day. I start with understand the power of abstraction, in this case I use the one model with styled components to define every component with needs forms. After that in the same way I learn to create adaptive and customs designers for buttons.

In the final of the day I finished the login authentication with firebase, for this case was needed to learn React Context and another functions from firebase. The entire structure and the logics is simple, but the sintax and the new features from  react and javascript in this moment is my bigger problem. 

## Sixth day

The day starts very nicely,  my studies began drilling the darkness walls  understand more deeply the concepts about React Context and data flow from react. The ZTM course is immersive and challenging, those's explainations is concise and faster. Now it's 13:52 pm.
