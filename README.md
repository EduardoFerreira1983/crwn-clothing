# Fourth day
I made progress and started with Routes from React and it works  very well.

In the afternoon I started working on firebase. First we connected to DB (Data Base) and did a login with google authentication.

In the evening I almost finished this part of the  project. After the battle with firebase and forms for a long time, finally  I finished to do a login with new users configuration.

## Fifth day

Today the time for studies is small its because is sunday and father's day. I start with understand the power of abstraction, in this case I use the one model with styled components to define every component with needs forms. After that in the same way I learn to create adaptive and customs designers for buttons.

In the final of the day I finished the login authentication with firebase, for this case was needed to learn React Context and another functions from firebase. The entire structure and the logics is simple, but the syntax and the new features from  react and javascript in this moment is my bigger problem. 

## Sixth day

The day starts very nicely,  my studies began drilling the darkness walls  understand more deeply the concepts about React Context and data flow from React. The ZTM course is immersive and challenging, those's explanations is concise and faster. Now it's 13:52 pm. In my time, this exercise starts to make sense. The process was did with a global view from the entire problem and now, indeed, go ahead  for another part, with more details in syntax and semantics. 

## Seventh day
Rest day, I just finished the project.

## Eighth day

After finished the Checkout part, today I wanna studies belong stuffs in the "back end part" like connections with firebase, fetching. Let's go!
