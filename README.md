I start with understand the power of abstraction, in this case I use the one model with styled components to define every component with needs forms. After that in the same way I learn to create adaptive and customs designers for buttons.

In the final of the day I finished the login authentication with firebase, for this case was needed to learn React Context and another functions from firebase. The entire structure and the logics is simple, but the syntax and the new features from  react and javascript in this moment is my bigger problem.
